            :markdown
              Well isn't that the $64,000 question. The whole picture is very sophistocated, so I'll just give
              a general high-level overview of the core architecture. Of course I'm always available to talk
              about the [stack](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solution_stack) in greater detail, so don't hesitate to 
              [hit me up](mailto:avi.romanoff@jbha.org).


              Basically, when you log into Keeba, two [sessions](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Session_(computer_science)#HTTP_session_token)
              are created -- one on the Keeba cloud, and one on jbha.org/students. The remote session allows Keeba to talk with the school's
              homework website at jbha.org/students using a fully reverse-engineered protocol to authenticate
              and read your account data. This data is then parsed, sanitized, and serialized into
              Keeba's cloud database, which is powered by [MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/).


              The browser-side client is an [HTML5](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5) webapp powered by [Backbone.js](http://backbonejs.org/) 
              and [Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/), among other technologies. It talks with the server over [Socket.IO](http://socket.io/), 
              an adaptive [JSON](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON)-based realtime transport layer. The server is a single-threaded 
              [forking](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fork_(operating_system)) [node.js](http://nodejs.org/) instance which exposes 
              [CRUD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete) access to Keeba's database
              and serves static content.
        article
          h3.help-header Is Keeba secure?
          .help-body
            :markdown
              The short answer is **yes**. Keeba does not log or store your authentication credentials.


              That said, it is important to remember that like the jbha.org homework website, you are submitting your email credentials in 
              [plaintext](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plaintext) over a unencrypted HTTP connection. Therefore it may be easier for
              a malicious party to [intercept](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack) and/or modify that traffic in transit.


              Furthermore, your data is stored by a third-party cloud database provider, [MongoLab](https://mongolab.com/home). This provider runs its
              service atop an industry-leading and highly secure cloud platform, Amazon Web Services (AWS). You can review their security policies and
              certifications [on their website](http://aws.amazon.com/security/).


              Obviously, you take full responsibility for your use of Keeba. The operators of Keeba are NOT liable for any poential data
              compromise or loss.
        article
          h3.help-header Who pays for Keeba?
          .help-body
            :markdown
              The school does. Keeba is hosted on the [Heroku](http://heroku.com/) cloud and it's database is hosted by [MongoLab](https://mongolab.com/home).
              Both of these platforms are physically hosted on Amazon's AWS US-EAST infrastructure, located in Virginia.

              The code, design, and development of Keeba was all done by me (Avi) in his spare time.

          .help-body
            :markdown
              That could be a number of things. If you're using Keeba on a congested or slow Internet connection (as the school Internet can be at times),
              Keeba will might feel sluggish. Try finding a better connection or closing apps that might be hogging your Internet bandwidth, such as
              streaming music (Pandora, Spotify, etc) or video (YouTube, iTunes downloads).

              If you're using an older computer (more than 6 years), Keeba might run slowly. It does do a fair bit of data-crunching in the browser.
              Switching to one of the supported browsers [listed here](/unsupported) might help.

          .help-body
            :markdown
              Most likely, you just forgot your email password. Click [here](https://www.google.com/a/jbha.org/DomainContact?service=mail)
              to reset it via our school's official GMail password reset tool.

              Another possibility is that the actual homework website is down. See if you can log in to the jbha.org website
              [here](http://www.jbha.org/students/homework.php). If you can't, the problem isn't Keeba and you should contact the school.

              Alternatively, Keeba might be having trouble connecting to the server because of a bug. If you can log in with the above link,
              but not on keeba.jbha.org, then it might actually be Keeba's fault. You should [contact Avi](mailto:avi.romanoff@jbha.org) if you
              think this is the case.
