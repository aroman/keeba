            1. **Keeba is not an excuse**
            While Keeba can be a very helpful and useful tool for managing your school life,
            that doesn't mean you can blame it for not being responsible with assignments.
            Your homework is YOUR responsibilty.

            2. **Keeba is not a replacement**
            Your planner might not be as interactive and fun as Keeba, but it's still an essential tool. Use it!

            3. **Keeba is not perfect**
            Keeba is very stable, but it's still new and might goof up.
            Please check the [Help section](/help) first if you run into a problem.
            If you're still having trouble, [let Avi know](mailto:avi.romanoff@jbha.org) and I'll try to help you out if I can.
